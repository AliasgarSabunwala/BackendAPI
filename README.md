# insta-API-in-Go

Here, I'm building a fully-fledged REST API that exposes GET, POST and 
    PUT endpoints that will subsequently allow you to perform the create user, userid, password, posts and see all posts.
    Also, we will be writing this REST API in such a way that it will be easy to update the 
    functions we will be defining so that they make subsequent calls to a database to perform any 
    necessary CRUD operations.
