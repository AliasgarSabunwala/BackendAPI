/*
    Here, I'm building a fully-fledged REST API that exposes GET, POST, DELETE and 
    PUT endpoints that will subsequently allow you to perform the full range of CRUD operations 
    to create user, userid, password, posts and see all posts.
    Also, we will be writing this REST API in such a way that it will be easy to update the 
    
    functions we will be defining so that they make subsequent calls to a database to perform any 
    necessary CRUD operations.
